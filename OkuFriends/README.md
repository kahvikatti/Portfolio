OkuFriends is a mobile game made by Game Development students from Riveria, commissioned by the city of Outokumpu. It is a GPS based adventure that guides the player around the city centre in the real world.

I worked on the prototype with a small team from November to December  2020. The project was taken up again in June 2021 and finished by myself in October 2021.

Throughout the project, I was in charge of project management and programming, and later I also released the final product on Google Play.

The game utilizes:<br>
[Easy Save - The Complete Save Data & Serialization System](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/easy-save-the-complete-save-data-serialization-system-768)<br>
[Fungus](https://fungusgames.com)<br>
[GO Map - 3D Map for AR Gaming](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/go-map-3d-map-for-ar-gaming-68889)

The finished project is available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.NiceTryNY.OkuFriends).<br>
A short PC demo is available on [my itch.io page](https://kahvikatti.itch.io/okufriends).
