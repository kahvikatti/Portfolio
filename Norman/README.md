Norman was a solo project made in three months (March - May 2021) for my Game Development degree. I made everything from scratch, except for music and sound effects.

Norman is a stealth game utilizing Unity's Configurable Joints and Fixed Joints to create physics-based chaos.

The finished project is available on [my itch.io page](https://kahvikatti.itch.io/norman).
