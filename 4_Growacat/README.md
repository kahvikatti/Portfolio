<h1 align="center">Growacat</h1>

Growacat is a mobile game about gardening and collecting cats. It is currently in the very early stages of development.

Here you can find all of the project files associated with it. You can find scripts written by myself in the [Assets/Resources/Scripts](https://github.com/kahvikatti/Portfolio/tree/main/4_Growacat/Assets/Resources/Scripts) folder and its subfolders.
